# Python OCR project (Tesseract)
This project was going to be some sort of game bot but the project was abandoned and I didn't continue to develop this app. But making this project contributed to me a lot in terms of OCR's, Python and Desktop App's.

## What does it do?
This program lets you take a screenshot of rectangle that you draw and displays its coordinates. After that OCR will try to read what is written on screenshot and if it is able to read that it will display on application.
